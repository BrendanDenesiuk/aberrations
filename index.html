                <b><i>Aberrations in the Aperture</i></b> is an ongoing photography
                project, focusing on distortions & glitches—acting as a sort
                of “corrupted file” of my life. All photographs shown here are
                unedited (apart from occasional cropping) & captured with
                a damaged Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ2. How the camera
                came to be this way is still a mystery, but the appearance of the
                photographs has something to do with the CCD sensor being
                busted.
                <br>
                The focus of these images is on various locations & objects
                relevant to my life, alongside my own artworks. Each photograph
                becomes distorted in its own different way—sometimes they are
                pink & totally illegible, other times they seem to be overwhelmed
                by lines & static, & other times still they become almost fully
                black & white.
                <br><br>
                These photographs create a bridge between my work, as the
                photographer, & the camera itself; though I fully dictate what the
                photos are of, it's entirely up to the camera to decide if future
                viewers will be able to make any sense of what was captured.
                <br><br>
                This project manifests itself in a curated set of what I personally
                find to be the most interesting photographs.
